Custom Typography: Integrates the "Open Sans" font from Google Fonts to give the design a professional and modern aesthetic.

Semantic HTML: Built with clear and semantic HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility.

Visual Appeal: Features rounded corners, subtle hover effects on buttons, and clear visual hierarchy for an engaging user interface.
